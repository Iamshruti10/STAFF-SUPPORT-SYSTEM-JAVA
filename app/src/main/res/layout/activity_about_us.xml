tializing from exam paper preparations to results, from studentâ€™s
details to faculty attendance, from project reports to extra activ-
ities, departments also generate a big database even in a month.
Thus, in order to maintain such database and even to handle such
kind of large activities, we need to have some automatically work-
ing system, which does not require much labor work and can be
done easily. This staff support system is being generated for such
purpose only to maintain all the work power of the department in
a single database. This model will also be able to solve the prob-
lem of time as the current system is very time consuming and this
project is being developed keeping in mind time problem. This
is paperless work. It can monitored and controlled remotely it re-
duce man power required. It provides accurate information always.
Malpractice can be reduced. All gathered and extra information
can be saved and can be accessed at any time. The data which is
stored in the project helps in taking intelligent and quick decisions
by the management. So it is better to have a App-Based Informa-
tion Management system. All the stakeholders, staff members can
get the desired information without delay."
